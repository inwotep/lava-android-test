LAVA Android Test Documentation
===============================

LAVA Android Test is a wrapper framework exposing unified API and command line
interface for running arbitrary tests and storing the results in a structured
manner.

LAVA Android Test is a part of the LAVA stack and can be used with other LAVA
components, most notably the dispatcher (for setting up the test environment
and controlling execution of multiple tests) and the dashboard (for storing)

Features
========

* Ability to enumerate, install, run and remove tests on a Linux-based system.
* Support for benchmarks as well as pass/fail tests.
* Support for capturing android environment information such as installed packages and
  hardware information and recording that in a machine-readable manner.
* Store results in raw form (log files) as well as Linaro Dashboard Bundle
  format that can be uploaded to the LAVA Dashboard for archiving and analysis.
* Extensible API for adding new tests (:class:`~lava_android_test.api.ITest`)
* Ever-growing collection of freely available and generic tests and benchmarks 

Quickstart
==========

This example will run on Ubuntu Lucid and beyond.  we should better to install it 
in an virtual environment, so that it will not mess up with the system environment::

 $ virtualenv ${workspace}                 ### create the virtual environment
 $ source ${workspace}/bin/activate        ### enter the virtual environment
 $ pip install --upgrade lava-android-test ### install the latest package to the the virtual environment
 $ lava-android-test install monkey        ### install the test named monkey
 $ lava-android-test run monkey            ### run the monkey test
 $ virtualenv ${workspace}                 ### exit the virtual environment
